<xmp theme="readable" style="display:none;">

I would personally like to thank you and welcome you to The Moe Dungeon, and encourage you to have fun! Before we begin I would like to encourage you to click on the gear in the lower left of your Discord page. From here you can select yourself a nice display picture and change various user settings. While here, I encourage you to select Push To Talk if you are in an enviorment with lots of background noise.

----------------------
# RULES:

1. Use a Microphone, No one wants to hear your echoey feedback.
1. Be Respectful and Generally Nice (Unless RP calls for otherwise)
1. No Trolling or Excessive Meme(ing) unless in an appropriate channel.
1. NFSW is allowed but discouraged in public channels. If you post an NSFW link, mark it as such.
1. Spoilers should be marked as spoilers. When in doubt, take it to PMs. Some of us haven't seen the new Star Wars.
1. No Doxing, personal threats, or harassment will be tolerated.
1. No Pedo-Shit even in private channels (this will result in a permaban)
1. Do not invite your own bots. If you would like to add a bot to the server, reach out to a mod.
1. A kick is a warning to reflect on your actions. Too many kicks will result in a ban.

----------------------
If you need a mod to help you with a problem, silmply use an (@) followed by the Mods Name or through a private message.
